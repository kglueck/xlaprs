* 22 Mar 2004 - will@loopfree.net
- add WX decode of cXXXgXXX for stations that don't send wind in XXX/XXX format
- fix up wx display a bit to avoid junk on lcd, give wind report in more 
   standard format (close to "wind 335 at 12" like the aviation standard")
- tweak aprsline widget placement to be on correct boundaries of 6

* 14 Dec 2003 - kglueck@viz.tamu.edu
- display.py: added enqueueing of commands 'beacon' and 'usr1' to
  facilitate extra buttons in my setup (beacon uses I, usr1 uses
  F).  usr1 command isn't currently used anywhere.
- router.py: accepts 'beacon' command and sets the beaconnow flag.
  beacon is currently a global command, not localized to a specific
  display screen.
- tcpconsole.py: changes beacon tcpcommand to enqueue a beacon
  command to the router rather than directly set the beaconnow
  flag.
- aprsscr.py/gpsscr.py: added hooks to display APM information via
  apm module found at http://www.iapp.de/~riemer/projects/apm.py/
  near screen name.  if apm.py not installed, apm stuff is ignored.
- tnc.py: changed the printing of the tx'd frame from direct to a
  repr(frame) so it wouldn't mess with the terminal screen.

* 27 Oct 2003 - kglueck@viz.tamu.edu
- aprsscr.py: fixed a goof I did yesterday...

* 26 Oct 2003 - kglueck@viz.tamu.edu

* 26 Oct 2003 - will@loopfree.net
- aprs.py - change parsing structure around a bit -- DispatchPacket
  func now handles sending packets off to various ParseXXX funcs.
  ParseXXX funcs call DecodeXXX to decode subsets of packet data.
  rmed radix argument from getfloat, was breaking lots of stuff
  rmed dupe ultimeter decoding code
- TODO/README - convert to unix newline format from DOS (whoops!)

* 19 Oct 2003 - kglueck@viz.tamu.edu
- NOTE: if you've used the pickling feature added on Oct 16, you
  will need to delete your xlaprs.state file as structure of
  AprsMessage class has been fixed.  It'll run, but will bail out
  when you display the message screen.

- widget.py: updated Mesgline to include other updates and slightly
  reformated into more readable format
- aprsscr.py/mesgscr.py: fixed counter at bottom of screen

- tcpconsole.py/router.py: fixed braindead way I originally put
  beaconnow in

* 16 Oct 2003 - kglueck@viz.tamu.edu
- aprs.py: added aging of messages (via config/aprs/maxmsgage) and
  also auto dropping of message to keep our total in memory <= 60
  NOTE: this value is hardcoded now...should it be configurable in
  the config file?
- aprs.py: changed a few debug 'levels' to allow some stuff to be
  printed and other not.
- aprs.py: added support to auto answer ?APRSS and ?APRSP queries

- config.py: added loading and saving of aprs/messages and
  aprs/stations structures from db via python's pickle module

  class to be pickled (python cannot pickle file objects)
- xlaprs.py: added a call to config.Save() at end to save state and
  config
- aprsscr.py: fixed bug in pressing Left on Detail screen would bail

* 15 Oct 2003 - kglueck@viz.tamu.edu
- nogps.py: created to allow a static gps position to be used w/o
  a gps attached to the system.  pulls time from system clock.
- xlaprs.py: added hook for nogps

* 14 Oct 2003 - kglueck@viz.tamu.edu
- mesgscr.py: created to display messages received.  still needs work
  to display all features
- xlaprs.py: added mesgscr to lcd screen list after aprs details
- aprs.py: fixed bug in original default for message type
- tcpconsole.py: added 'getmsg' command to display messages in list.
  syntax is 'getmsg CALL-SSID/hash' (ex: N5TLT-12/-437279042) or just
  'getmsg 0'
- widget.py: added MesgLine class

* 12 Oct 2003 - kglueck@viz.tamu.edu

- tnc.py: added a few returns after recv bad KISS data to keep tnc from
  bombing out with an error
- aprs.py: added aprsdebug at the top of Aprs class to toggle debug data
- aprs.py: added an AprsMessage class for messaging and various code to
  parse and assemble messages (ParseMesg and TxMesg respectively)

  up a bit still.
- aprs.py: added to AprsCalc code to sort messages by time received
- tcpconsole.py: added a 'msg' command to be able to send a raw message.
  this is BAAAD...it BLINDLY sends what is given...be careful!

* 10 Oct 2003 - kglueck@viz.tamu.edu
- tcpconsole.py: added 'putkey' to allow changing of in memory database
  objects without going through step-by-step interface.  warning, the data
  sent to db w/o much error checking, so...use at your own risk!
- tcpconsole.py: added 'beacon' to allow an immediate beacon of position
  tx is enabled.
- router.py: added 'beacon' command
- aprs.py: added beaconnow code to MaybeTx
- aprs.py: added wx decoding for !! Ultimeter reports
- aprs.py: fixed bug in agestr in GetAgeStrLong()

  APRS Detail screen to get to it)

* 09 Oct 2003 - kglueck@viz.tamu.edu
- fixed a few snafu's with wx decoding
- added an option on getint/getfloat to be able to specify number base for
  conversion between bases...if not specified, defaults to base 10

- backed out change made on 01 Oct 2003 in display.py (reverted back to
  rev 1.4 of display.py)  NOTE: xon=1 functionality in diff provided by
  Will and added to cvs as util/pyserial.diff.  Diff made on pyserial-1.18
- added a large try/except block around parse that catches the exception
  IndexError when bad data is in the very very wild APRS stream
- added some wx variables and wx payload decoding for complete wx reports,
  these variables are currently unused elsewhere, just being show on the
  debug output.  need to test, expand, and add to aprs station detail
  screen
- added wx decoding of Ultimeter packet payloads...untested

* 01 Oct 2003 - kglueck@viz.tamu.edu
- fixed bug in display.py's setting of Xon/Xoff flow control of serial port

  tnc/enable currently unused
- added to xlaprs.conf gps/type (possible settings, 'm12' or 'nmea')
- added to xlaprs.conf misc/debug setting, added debug hooks in xlaprs.py
  and nmea.py
